Alabastard
----------

A fork of the [Alabaster theme](https://digitalcraftsman.github.io/hugo-alabaster-theme/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

It's based on the Alabaster theme for [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/), which I use to generate the Python docs for some of my projects.

This fork is adapted more towards a blog than documentation.


Licence
-------

The theme is released under [the BSD license](LICENCE.md), same as the theme its forked from.
